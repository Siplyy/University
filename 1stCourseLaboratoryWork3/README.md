# Homework on the subject: "Programming languages"

## Higher School of Economics, Computer Security, 1st year

### Task condition

A sequence of sentences ending with a period is introduced. Sentences can take up more than one line. Print all sentences in non-decreasing order of length exactly one per line, replacing the line break in the original input with a space character. The program code must contain input from the console of the --to file and --from file flags. The first one tells us that the input will be set to a file specified by the user on the command line (if there is no file, create it), and the second one tells us about reading from a file specified by the user. Provide for the possibility of executing both flags. Take into account the possibility of incorrect input and process the exceptions.
