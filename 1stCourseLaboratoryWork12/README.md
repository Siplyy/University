### Task condition

Filter Iterator:
Create your own iterator that iterates through the container and returns only those elements that meet certain criteria (for example, odd numbers, prime numbers, etc.). The iterator must have a constructor that accepts another iterator and a function object that defines the filtering criteria. Test the filter iterator with the container of your choice.
